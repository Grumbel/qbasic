This is QBasic code written from 1993 to 1997 by Ingo Ruhnke.

may contains code by third parties.


Running
-------

A copy of QBasic can be found at:

* http://www.qbasic.net/en/qbasic-downloads/compiler/qbasic-interpreter.htm

It can be used with [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com/).

Useful keyboard bindings are:

* F5: start a QBasic program
* Ctrl-ScrollLock: Interrupt a running QBasic program
* Ctrl-F10: escape DOSBox's mouse-grab
* Ctrl-F11: lower emulation speed
* Ctrl-F12: increase emulation speed

QBasic source code should be placed in `C:\basic\`, otherwise some of
the programs might not find their datafiles.

Some programs require a joystick.
